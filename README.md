## cl-sim

CL-Sim is a simple Python library for creating simulations of the classic children's game [Chutes and Ladders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_Ladders). I created the script initially to determine whether or not there was a statistically signficant first-move advantage in the game. The question was inspired by the routine beating I was getting from my four-year-old son who seemed to be winning way more than 50% of the time.

## Installation

Download and put the script somewhere where you can import it into your own Python scripts.

## Examples

I've included four example scripts in the `examples` folder. They should give you some ideas about how to use the `cl.py` library.
